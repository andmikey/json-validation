* JSON validation service
** What is this?
A RESTful service written in Scala; allows users to validate JSON documents against JSON schemas.  

** Technical architecture
The key part of the app is a Scalatra server. This receives POST and GET requests and processes them according to the following endpoints:
| Route                   | Purpose                                                                   |
|-------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| POST /schema/SCHEMAID   | Upload a JSON Schema with unique `SCHEMAID`                               |
| GET /schema/SCHEMAID    | Download a JSON Schema with unique `SCHEMAID`                             |
| POST /validate/SCHEMAID | Validate a JSON document against the JSON Schema identified by `SCHEMAID` |

The `JSONServlet` class handles incoming requests on the above routes, and passes them to the `JSONSchema` object.

The following respones are possible on a GET/POST request: 
| Route                   | Status code | Reason                                         |
|-------------------------+-------------+------------------------------------------------|
| POST /schema/SCHEMAID   |         201 | Schema successfully saved to database          |
| POST /schema/SCHEMAID   |         500 | Schema could not be saved to database          |
| GET /schema/SCHEMAID    |         200 | Schema successfully retrieved                  |
| GET /schema/SCHEMAID    |         404 | Schema could not be retrieved                  |
| POST /validate/SCHEMAID |         200 | Document successfully validated against schema |
| POST /validate/SCHEMAID |         500 | Document could not be validated against schema |
| Any other route         |         404 | Route not found                                |


The `JSONSchema` object has the following publicly-accessible methods:

| Method   | Purpose                                              |
|----------+------------------------------------------------------|
| add      | Add a JSON Schema to the database if it is valid     |
| get      | Retrieve JSON Schema  from the database if it exists |
| validate | Validate a JSON Document against a JSON Schema       |

** Building and running
The database need to be a PostgreSQL instance running on port 5432, as standard. To set up the required database and tables:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
$ psql -U postgres -c "CREATE DATABASE jsonapp WITH OWNER = postgres;"
$ psql -U postgres -d jsonapp -c "CREATE TABLE jsonschemas(schemaid varchar PRIMARY KEY, json varchar);"
#+END_SRC

To run the app:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
$ cd json-validation
$ sbt
> jetty:start
#+END_SRC

The app should be running on http://localhost:8080/. 

To run tests:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh

#+END_SRC
